# Documentation

MediaManager currently uses GitBook for documentation.

The files for the documentation are in the \`/docs\` directory. They are \_mostly\_ standard markdown.

Unfortunately GitBook doesn't provide a way to locally preview the documentation. Instead you can submit a PR with your proposed changes and a GitBook workflow will run which will provide a link to the preview.

To access the preview just open the \`Details\` link.
