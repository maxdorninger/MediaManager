# Documentation

MediaManager uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with
the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for documentation.

The files for the documentation are in the `/docs` directory.

To preview the documentation locally, you need to have mkdocs or Docker installed.

## How to preview the documentation locally with docker

1. Run the mkdocs container in `docker-compose.dev.yaml`

2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:9000/` in your browser.
